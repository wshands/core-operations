Set up differences for RNA-seq UNC pipeline

Setup the cluster the same way as for RNA-seq non UNC, but instead of needing a venv and pip installing toil-scripts, 
you'll `git clone toil-scripts -b releases/2.0.x`
you'll also need to use `cgcloud ssh-cluster` to `pip uninstall toil` and reinstall `pip install toil==3.1.6` to all the nodes
 
There is a convenience script for running on mesos, which you'll edit to change bucket other settings etc.  
The config you create (there is an example in the directory), must be on every machine, so you'll use the `--share` 
option and pass in a location where that file is, which will be on `/home/mesosbox/shared`

#instead of steps 1-7
#ssh as administrator into the Toil leader (-a) so you can do sudo apt-get to install git
cgcloud ssh â€”a cluster-name issue88UNCRNA-seq toil-leader
#install git on the leader
sudo apt-get install git
#exit out of the leader
exit

#the workers were created the cluster, so we need to remove current Toil from all of them
#use CGCloud to remove the current Toil version from the workers
cgcloud ssh-cluster --admin toil -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no sudo pip uninstall -y toil
#install Toil version 3.1.6 on all the workers
cgcloud ssh-cluster --admin toil -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no sudo pip install toil==3.1.6

#log back into the Toil leader
cgcloud ssh --cluster-name issue88UNCRNA-seq toil-leader
#clone the correct toil scripts repo
git clone https://github.com/BD2KGenomics/toil-scripts -b releases/2.0.x
#edit the launch script to make sure paths and options are setup correctly
vim /home/mesosbox/toil-scripts/src/toil_scripts/rnaseq_unc/launch_unc_mesos.sh
#start a screen session so we can log back in and see progress
screen
#set the script as executable
chmod 775 launch_unc_mesos.sh 
#run the launch script
./launch_unc_mesos.sh
